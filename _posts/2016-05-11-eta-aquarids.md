description: "My alarm went off at 1:30am. I didn't get up immediately, but I eventually rolled myself out of bed. Quickly getting dressed and grabbing my camera, I set out for an early morning drive to Katoomba (in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney). Along the way I picked up Wayne - a good friend and brother in Christ. We stopped and camped ourselves at a point, looking towards the constellation Aquarius, which is where the meteor shower we were hoping to see originates from. Because of the light from the city (facing east), we couldn't see much. So we drove to the other side of the mountainside to face west. What greeted us was the most incredible sight! It was a new moon, so no lunar light to knock out any stars. We could see the cloud of the Milky Way with our own eyes! In the next 40 minutes we were there, we counted 16 streaks across the sky. Though I wasn't able to capture any streaks on my camera, I did walk away with an awesome shot of the night sky. How amazing is our Creator, to lovingly craft a beautiful painting of light for those who are willing to set out to see it. Seeing all those stars made me feel small, but in a good way. How big our God is who created all things, and how much smaller must we be. This BIG God who offers salvation and eternal life in His holy and glorious presence to mere creatures. Praise Him!"
