# Why a blog/website about gratitude?

Well here's the thing - I'm a busy person. On a scale from "meh" to "I'M SO LATE AND HAVE HAD SO MANY COFFEE'S TO MAKE UP FOR THE LACK OF SLEEP" it's at about "so much to do, but still enough time for rest". And as a busy person, I don't take enough time to reflect and just be grateful for the little things - at times I don't even find myself being grateful for the big things either!  
S0 this blog/website is really just a personal thing. I want to stop and take time to give praise to the one who, in His common grace, gives us good things.  
To start off, I'm really really really thankful for coffee. Oh man, where would I be without it?! Did you know that the climate as well as the altitude of where the coffee plants are grown make as much of a difference to the method of removing the bean from the cherries and the kind of roasting you do? Did you know that the storage of the beans is as important as the grind settings and length of time between grind to extraction regarding freshness of your coffee and quality of your crema?  
Do you properly thank your barista in the mornings (or afternoons... or possibly evenings) for the work they do to serve you? For the care they take to ensure your coffee is as good as it can be? Do you thank the God who created all things and gave us coffee beans?  
Maybe take a moment now to give thanks to God, and remember to say thank you to your barista next you see them.
