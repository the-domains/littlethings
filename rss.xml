            <title><![CDATA[Our First Home]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Our First Home</h1><p>We are just about to move out of our first home, and we're quite sad about it. Not to say we aren't happy with where we are going, but we have had a lot of good memories from our time here.This was a home where we started our journey as a married couple. We had people over to share meals with, hosted people from overseas, dealt with big spiders and went to war with the pooping pigeons on our balcony.More than that - this was our first sanctuary in marriage. The place we came home to together, or met one another after our days at work or while out for other reasons. It was once an empty space we began renting, but was soon filled by the loving generosity of family and friends.We were so very blessed to have had this home, God most certainly provided above and beyond our needs - we are so grateful to have had the opportunity to have lived here and praise God for the two years he placed us here.~ 13.Feb.2016</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/07dd4c9415ddc9972029b2cd455b53a672fce7b5.png"></article>]]></description>
