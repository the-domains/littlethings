I didn't get up immediately, but I eventually rolled myself out of bed. Quickly getting dressed and grabbing my camera, I set out for an early morning drive to Katoomba (in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney).<br>Along the
    way I picked up Wayne - a good friend and brother in Christ. We stopped and camped ourselves at a point, looking towards the constellation Aquarius, which is where the meteor shower we were hoping to see originates from. Because of the light from
    the city (facing east), we couldn't see much. So we drove to the other side of the mountainside to face west. What greeted us was the most incredible sight! It was a new moon, so no lunar light to knock out any stars. We could see the cloud of the
    Milky Way with our own eyes! In the next 40 minutes we were there, we counted 16 streaks across the sky.<br>Though I wasn't able to capture any streaks on my camera, I did walk away with an awesome shot of the night sky.<br>How amazing is our Creator,
    to lovingly craft a beautiful painting of light for those who are willing to set out to see it. Seeing all those stars made me feel small, but in a good way. How big our God is who created all things, and how much smaller must we be. This BIG God
    who offers salvation and eternal life in His holy and glorious presence to mere creatures. Praise Him!</p><picture>

Not to say we aren't happy with where we are going, but we have had a lot of good memories from our time here.<br>This was a home where we started our journey as a married couple. We had people over to share meals with, hosted people from overseas, dealt with big spiders and went to war with the pooping pigeons on our balcony.<br>More than that - this was our first sanctuary in marriage. The place we came home to together, or met one another after our days at work or while out for other reasons. It was once an empty space we began renting, but was soon filled by the loving generosity of family and friends.<br>We were so very blessed to have had this home, God most certainly provided above and beyond our needs - we are so grateful to have had the opportunity to have lived here and praise God for the two years he placed us here.<br>~ 13.Feb.2016</p></div></div></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="86"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="87"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="88"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="89"><span data-reactid="90"><!-- react-empty: 91 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="92"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="93">The Little Things | Gratitude</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="94"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="95"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="96"></div></div></div></section></div></div>

of our first home, and we're quite sad about it. Not to say we aren't happy with where we are going, but we have had a lot of good memories from our time here. This was a home where we started our journey as a married couple. We had people over to share meals with, hosted people from overseas, dealt with big spiders and went to war with the pooping pigeons on our balcony. More than that - this was our first sanctuary in marriage. The place we came home to together, or met one another after our days at work or while out for other reasons. It was once an empty space we began renting, but was soon filled by the loving generosity of family and friends.
